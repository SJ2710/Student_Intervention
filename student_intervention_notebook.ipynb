    "**Answer:** The 3 supervised learning technique that I would like to use here are:\n",
    "   First- SVC (Support Vector Classifier):\n",
    "   SVC works better when the size of the data is small and also in high dimensionality. Our dataset is small and contains lesser    noise with high number of features. Another reason for choosing this would be its wide variety of use of kernels. Different      kernels can be used for the decision functions. Also, SVC has effeciency when it comes to memory as it uses te support          vectors(subsets of training points).\n",
    "   But then, it can not give the desired results when the feature size greater than the sample size.And it does not provide        probability estimates.\n",
    "   One real world example where SVC can be used is text categorizations, image classification, bioinformatics( protein              classification, cancer classification etc).\n",
    "   Second-Decision Tree Classifier:\n",
    "   The prediction to be made is binary whether a student passes or fails, so this approach is good one to adopt.This can be very    easily visualized,understood and interpreted.Predictions are done in loagarithmic time and hence it saves money.But again,      there are disadvantages such as overfitting.Also, if there is any change in original data, then the decision tree has to be      built over and again.Balancing the data is very much required in case of using Decision tree algorithm as it may create          biased trees when some class dominates.\n",
    "   Third-Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "   This can predict well even with small data because it uses the available evidences. Naive Bayes Classifier are very fast in      execution. But it is widely known to be a bad estimator. Applications may involve in the areas such as detection of spam        mail, or classify a news into categories such as technology, sports or politics, it is also widely used in the sentiment        analysis to check whether a piece of text is expressing a positive or negative emotions.\n",

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

Now answer these small questions based on your observations. Each answer contributes to the tree. A tree that requires lesser but important factors to get an accurate prediction is to be taken. With this tree, you can make a decision if she will love the dress or not."
